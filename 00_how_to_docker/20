#A Docker Swarm is a group of either physical or virtual machines that are 
#running the Docker application and that have been configured to join together 
#in a cluster. Docker swarm is a container orchestration tool, meaning that 
#it allows the user to manage multiple containers deployed across multiple 
#host machines.
